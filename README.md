# SQLViewer
<!-- TOC --><a name="context"></a>
## Context
Project of the subject of Accessing Data From Program Code of the Software Engineering degree at Algebra University College (Zagreb). The project consist in a  replica of the SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio).
The project is completely done in C# with the Form Window framework. Part of the code is done with the help of the Professor Daniel Bele.

### Login
The application has a SQL Server Authentication in order to use it. So it handle non registered users and so on.

#### Running The New Query
When running the query, if it is a `Select` query, the application will show the table as it is shown when the run table action. The errors happened in the query will be shown in the message-box. Here there are some examples of how the run query works:

<!-- TOC --><a name="patterns"></a>
## Patterns
The patterns used in this project are:
<!-- TOC --><a name="lazy"></a>
### Lazy
The Lazy pattern it is mostly used by the tree view. So this tree view will load only what he needs when a node is expanded. All the entities (tables, views and procedures) inside the `database` object are lazy properties.
<!-- TOC --><a name="factory"></a>
### Factory
The factory pattern is used to create objects that implements the `IRepository` interface. 
<!-- TOC --><a name="singleton"></a>
### Singleton
The factory of `IRepository`s is a singleton.
