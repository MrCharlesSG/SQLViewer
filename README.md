# SQLViewer
## Context
Project of the subject of Accessing Data From Program Code of the Software Engineering degree at Algebra University College (Zagreb). The project consist in a  replica of the SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio).
The project is completely done in C# with the Form Window framework. Part of the code is done with the help of the Professor Daniel Bele.
## Functionality
### Login

#### Running The New Query
When running the query, if it is a `Select` query, the application will show the table as it is shown when the run table action. The errors happened in the query will be shown in the message-box. Here there are some examples of how the run query works:
